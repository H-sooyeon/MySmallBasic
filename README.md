# MySmallBasic for Everyone
MySmallBasic is the first open-source software for Small Basic coding environment. This project aims at pushing Small Basic as the first computer language for people who like to learn computer programming. It is started by SWLAB at Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Korea.

## Features
- A Java-based implementation that can run not only on Windows, but also on other operating systems such as Linux and Mac.
- Supports the standard library of Small Basic (Array, Clock, Controls, Desktop, Dictionary, File, Flickr, GraphicsWindow, ImageList, Math, Mouse, Network, Program, Shapes, Sound, Stack, TextWindow, Text, Timer, and Turtle)
- Supports a "super-easy" development of new Small Basic libraries, for example, two library extensions for Hamster robot and Weka-based data mining
- Supports a Small Basic debugger (set/unset breakpoints, step, continue, and start/stop debugging) with a GUI environment
- Supports two language extensions, (recursive) functions and assertion, that can be converted into the standard Small Basic language without the extended features

## Roadmap
- A *Graduation* function for Small Basic programmers to move to other programming languages such as Python, Java, and so
- A block-based coding environment based on Blockly
- A *Publish* function for people easy to share their Small Basic programs with others
- A sample curriculum for a lecture on Computational Thinking, which we plans to open at Chonnam National University, Spring 2018.
